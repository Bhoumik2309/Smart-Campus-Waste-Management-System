This project is an IoT-based Smart Waste Management System designed for campus environments to encourage efficient waste disposal and monitoring. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the fill level of a dustbin and provides real-time feedback through both local and remote interfaces.

Key Features:
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance from the lid to the trash level to determine if the bin is full or empty.

LCD Display Module: Displays the real-time distance value along with messages:

"Use the bin" when the bin is available (not full)

"Bin is full" when the dustbin reaches its limit

LED Indicators:

Green LED lights up when the bin is free

Red LED lights up when the bin is full

Blynk IoT Dashboard Integration:

Real-time distance data synced to Blynk app

Notification alert sent to users when the bin is full
